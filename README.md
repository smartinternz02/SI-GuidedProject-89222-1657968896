<h3>I have uploaded</h3>&nbsp &nbsp  dataset link(ECG-dataset-Link.txt) , <br>
 &nbsp &nbsp Trained model(ECG.h5) ,<br>
 &nbsp &nbsp   Project code (project1.ipynb),<br>
 &nbsp &nbsp  HTML pages(templates folder), and <br> 
 &nbsp &nbsp  flask file (app.py),<br>
 &nbsp &nbsp  Images for displaying in HTML pages (static folder).</p>

This project done by tensorflow, numpy modules and flask as a backend framework for HTML pages.

Firstly, we train the dataset
Secondly, we create an front-end by HTML,CSS and backend connectivity by flask.
Trained ECG.h5 keras data file is used for prediction of the user uplaoded ECG Image. 
Finally, the prediction result is displayed in Predict.html page.
